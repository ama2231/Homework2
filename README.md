# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

- I created an index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` file.

- Each of these pages has: (1) a navbar (2) a responsive layout based on bootstrap (3) responsive images that change: color, size, or a combination of both upon hover or click

- Contributions of bootstrap to my pages:
    - minimized my use of media quaries by sizing images for different screens
    - added ability of using containers, rows, and columns


### Minimum Requirements

I have met the basic requirements as stated:

- Application is functional
- I created a GitHub repository with README describing the project


### Bonus

I have partially completed the added bonus as stated:

- To use bootstrap, to make a sticky footer 


## Commit Early and Often

I was unable to reflect the consistency and quantity of my commits because I had an issue with the initial repository I started working on so I had to delete it.
